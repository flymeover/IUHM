Code and data used in Sensors "Research on learning data and data format for reducing quan-tization error in stereo vision system":
Using the code at https://github.com/ardiya/gc_net, we created a code for learning and evaluation using Disparity data and Normalized z-distance data as output values.
The codes were written based on Python3 and TensorFlow2 in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
Users can download the test data, modify the code according to the saved path, and run it.
