[Stereo Matching Algorithm Code]

The codes were written based on Python3 and TensorFlow2 in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

[Scene Flow Data]

Users can download data, modify the test code according to the saved path, and run it.

[Result]

The proposed model, IUHM surpasses existing models such as geometry and context network (GC-Net) and pyramid stereo matching network (PSMNet) in terms of disparity prediction accuracy and computational speed, consuming less than one-third of the memory.
